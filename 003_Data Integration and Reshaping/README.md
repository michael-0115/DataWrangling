### 003_Data Integration and Reshaping
* Task 1:To integrate data from two different data sources, indicated by S1 and S2 respectively,
    * S1 (data_s1_ass4.csv): contains 4,600 records.
    * S2 (data_s2_ass4.xml): contains 430 records. In order to finish the integration task, you will need to resolve schema conflicts (For example, structure conflicts, naming conflicts, and/or entity resolution conflicts) and data conflicts. The output of the task should be a unified data stored in a global schema that should be justified with a clear explanation of the semantic mapping between local schemas used in S1 and S2 and the global schema. While integrating the two datasets, you might need to add new columns, delete columns and merge columns.
* Task 2: Data Normalization and analyze how they affect the distribution of the data.
    * score normalization,
    * Min-Max normalization and
    * log transformation
