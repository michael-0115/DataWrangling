After examining the original XML file by editor, I found out that the file is not a well-formed XML file, which instead the file itself contains 2,500 individual XML files in it. So, the lxml’s XML parser can only successfully parses the first section as it recognizes the section that belong to a well-formed XML file structure.\n",

Or use Python’s html.parser with BeautifulSoup, it can parse the so call un-well-formed XML file without error. And I am going the use the Python’s html.parser to parse and extract data from XML files with Python."
